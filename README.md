- [x] Validations
  - [x] Validate that no values are left blank.
  - [x] Validate that all string values are less than 255 characters long (because that is the maximum size for our SQL columns).
  - [x] Validate that usernames contain only the whitelisted characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and \_.
  - [x] Validate that phone numbers contain only the whitelisted characters: 0-9, spaces, and ()-.
  - [x] Validate that email addresses contain only whitelisted characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and @.\_-.
  - [x] Add at least 5 other validations of your choosing. Consider what would be useful attributes to validate. Graders will be interested in the utility of the validation as much as the code execution. Add a code comment above each validation that says "My custom validation" (to make it easy to locate during grading).
    1. Improve email validation to take into account if there is a period, where it is located, and if there are letters around it.
    2. Validate that phone numbers have between 4 and 13 characters.
    3. Validate US State Codes can only be two digits.
    4. Validate State Codes must be alphabtical.
    5. Validate territory position is not the same as another territory in the same state;

- [x] Sanitization
  - [x] All input and dynamic output should be sanitized.
  - [x] Be sure to sanitize dynamic data when used for:
    - URLs
    - HTML
    - SQL

---

- [x] Penetration Testing
  - [x] Verify that all form text inputs are not vulnerable to SQLI attacks.
  - [x] Verify that all URL query strings are not vulnerable to SQLI attacks.
  - [x] Verify that all form text inputs are not vulnerable to XSS attacks.
  - [x] Verify that all URL query strings are not vulnerable to XSS attacks.
  - [x] Make a list of any other bugs or security vulnerabilities you are able to trigger by putting well-crafted data into a form value, in a query string, or in the database data.
  * Vulnerabilities
    1. I improperly thought I could use html entities to prevent sql query. I found the
    mysqli_real_escape_string,  which actually helped cover up these vulnerabilities.
    2. I also did not properly escape my feature when I was attemting to check a unique username,
    which allowed for a sql injection vulnerability
The following **optional** features are implemented:
- [x] Display the name of the state instead of the `territories.state_id`
- [x] Validate uniqueness of username both whena user is created and when updated


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add additional `has\_unique\_username` function to `validation_functions.php`
- [x] Add validation so that names can only container character, or the symbols period, comma, single quote, or a space
